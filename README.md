# IOSASRandomizer
A randomizer for the game Isles of Sea and Sky! Originally built for Archipelago multiworld.

NOTE: Because of this, this mod **does not** currently allow randomization from the patch.xDelta alone.


## QOL

There is a console that displays which items the player recieves. To diable/enable it press "C."

If---for whatever reason---the player is stuck and cannot move, press "Q"
